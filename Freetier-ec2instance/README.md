Sure, here's how you could describe the Terraform script in a README file:

## Terraform Script for Launching EC2 Instance

This Terraform script automates the process of launching an EC2 instance on AWS. Below is a breakdown of the script components:

### Terraform Block
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```
Specifies the required provider (in this case, AWS) and its version.

### Provider Block
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
Configures the AWS provider with the specified region.

### Resource Block
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-080e1f13689e07408"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "key"
  security_groups = ["launch-wizard-1"]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform_Demo"
  }
}
```
Defines an EC2 instance resource with specific configurations such as AMI, instance type, key name, security groups, and tags.

### Outputs
```hcl
output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
}

output "public_dns" {
  value = aws_instance.app_server.public_dns
}

output "ssh_command_dns" {
  value = "ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@${aws_instance.app_server.public_dns}"
}
```
Provides outputs for the public IP, public DNS, and SSH command to connect to the instance.
